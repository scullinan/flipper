# Flipper
An app to remotely control what is displayed on a browser - useful for wall monitors.

The project consists of a backend python REST api and a front end chrome extension adapted 
from the awesome [Revolver Tabs](https://code.google.com/p/revolver-chrome-extensions/) by Ben Hedrington.

## Use Cases
This project grew out of a need to display monitoring metrics on wall monitors in a browser without direct access to the browser. 
It is possible to manage the tabs that are flipped by using the REST api, this allows further use cases such as 'robots' pushing to wall
monitors on important events and thresholds.
